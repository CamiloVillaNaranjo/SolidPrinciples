#SOLIDPrinciples Solution

In this solution, I save different projects, each of which points to a particular Principle of SOLID, that's how we find
SRPPrinciple, OCPPrinciple, LSPPrinciple, ISPPrinciple, & DIPPrinciple.

Each of which presents a folder that has a "BadCode" code and its corresponding correction in the "GoodCode" folder.
