# SOLIDPrinciples Solution

In this solution, I save different projects, each of which points to a particular Principle of SOLID, that's how we find
**SRPPrinciple**, **OCPPrinciple**, **LSPPrinciple**, **ISPPrinciple**, & **DIPPrinciple**.

Each of which presents a folder that has a _BadCode_ folder, with a problem code and its corresponding correction in the _GoodCode_ folder.
